# `threejs-figwheel`

*NOTE*: project deprecated (and the toolchain is now broken); see [threejs-figwheel-main](https://github.com/cassiel/threejs-figwheel-main) for a rewrite in Figwheel Main.

An example project which brings up a minimal "live coding" environment for Clojure-based WebGL in the browser, courtesy of [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript), [three.js](http://threejs.org/) and [Figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel).

This is basically the Figwheel template project in Leiningen, with the core ClojureScript file set up to do some three.js, and a stripped-down `index.html` to host the results. The HTML also wheels in three.js from a CDN (so alter to taste).

Most of the effort in this project has gone into making the application state as nearly idempotent as possible, so that repeated page or code reloads don't result in multiple canvas instances, background rendering callbacks, and so on. The reloading is done by completely tearing down the canvas and rendering pipeline and rebuilding; for a proper live coding environment, or for bigger projects, this probably needs to be a bit more subtle.

This project is partially inspired by [this by Chris McCormick](https://github.com/chr15m/clojurescript-threejs-playground), [Henry Garner's Multisnake](https://github.com/henrygarner/multisnake), and [Chestnut](https://github.com/plexus/chestnut).

## Setup (from Figwheel docs)

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein figwheel

and open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).
This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

    lein clean

To create a production build run:

    lein cljsbuild once min

And open your browser in `resources/public/index.html`. You will not
get live reloading, nor a REPL.
